# ISO assessment from first pass

AFG: slope looks good - maybe earlier start?
ARG: early slope good - maybe earlier start? later slope too high?
BGD: early slope too low, too early intervention start, too low post-intervention slope
BHR: good match
BOL: good match
CHL: no shift?
COL: shift timing too early, early slope too high, post slope too high
CRI: two-peaked; initial phase too late, then needs negative trend, then new growth period
DJI: shift timing too early, early slope too low; later phase indicates R<1, but seems more like a noisy R ~= 1 appropriate
DOM: seems like too many introductions? maybe misfit on slope as well
GHA: empirical data is *really* noisy, but seems like intervention impact too early
GTM: good
HND: too early; slope isn't bad
HTI: seems unlikely to fit -
IRN: intervention too late? maybe needs more censored interval?
IRQ: intervention too early, but wants long intermediate window
ISR: intervention too late, otherwise good; candidate for second shift later
LKA: not bad? maybe...longer intervention fit window? could be flatter.
MEX: not bad? wants to be flatter
MUS: a little too early; wants higher pre-int slope. actually pretty good fit
NGA: later on intervention? otherwise looks pretty good
OMN: maybe a little later on intervention? otherwise pretty good?
PAN: pretty good, but needs second wave treatment
PRY: not obvious useful pre/post intervention period; if there is, maybe a little later?
QAT: needs earlier intervention
RWA: needs earlier case introductions; different intervention timing? maybe just a problem with intervention timing re intro timing?
SAU: needs an intervention timing; may ish?
SLV: needs an intervention timing; apr-may ish?
TGO: maybe too many intros, slightly later intervention start?
TUN: pretty good; maybe later post-intervention period? also needs later intervention relaxation
TUR: not bad, but wants intervention relaxation
URY: not bad, but wants intervention relaxation? maybe also slightly delayed intervention start. alternatively, could be continuous stuttering introduction chains? i.e. R<1, but close enough to see sparks.
VEN: no intervention timing
ZAF: R<1 estimate...wtf?

# Ideas:

 - smear intros a bit?
 - optional: for second waves, refit R0, with a multiplier of (1-exposed frac) on original umod?
 - get uncertainty in early R0 from different shift points?
